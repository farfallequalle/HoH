# Home Office Helper

application which runs in the systemtray to avoid appearing as AFK on Teams

When you run the HomeOfficeHelper.exe it will spawn in your Systray (bottom-right of your Windows PC).
You then have 2 options:   a) activate it (activated = ticked)
                           b) make is start on boot (activated = ticket)

It makes you appear as "online" by tapping "NUM" twice every 4 minutes, Teams puts you as AFK after ~5min.
There is not that much else to it, enjoy and feel free to ask for new features.
